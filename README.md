ML-SX: machine learning for the modelling of metal solvent extraction processes 

Solvent extraction is a crucial process to purify metals from either primary or secondary sources. Modelling solvent extraction processes is a cumbersome task requiring extensive experimental work to understand the behaviour of the metal in the aqueous and organic phases. 
A database containing around than 18,800 data points related to the extraction of 72 metals and non-metals and 5 acids extracted with tributyl phosphate (TBP) has been built and is used to train machine learning (ML) models. The database can be found in the "Database solvent extraction with TBP". The literature references to build the database can be found in the excel file. 

Data on the extraction of metals and acids were gathered by selecting studies where TBP is used (alone) as an extracting molecule. Since TBP has been used at the industrial scale for decades, data for multiple metals in multiple aqueous media are available (metals, nonmetals and acids extracted from sulfuric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, perchloric and fluoric acid media).  The periodic table displayed in Fig. 1 shows the metals, non-metals and protons (H) for which data is available, and the anion used in the aqueous solution considered.

The dataset regroups data for different oxidation states of the same metal when available, e.g. Cr(VI) and Cr(III), Cu(I) and Cu(II), or Pu(III) and Pu(VI). In most studies, TBP is used undiluted or diluted in conventional hydrocarbon diluents such as kerosene, heptane or dodecane, but the dataset also contains data for solvents such as carbon tetrachloride or chloroform. The features were selected in order to describe the extraction system as precisely as possible. Nature of the element extracted is represented by its oxidation state and its crystal radius. The crystal radius was selected based on the oxidation state of the element extracted. When multiple values are available, the value selected is based on the (arbitrarily chosen) coordination number of +VI (and high spin for Co(II), Fe(II) and Mn(II)). Other features relative to the aqueous phase are the acid concentration (in mol/L), the initial metal concentration (in g/L), and the features relative to the anion (crystal radius for +VI coordination number, and oxidation state). In addition, the anion’s concentration is corrected if a salt is present in the media. Different salts having different effects on the activity coefficients, the nature of the cation of the salt is taken into account (using its crystal radius). If another anion is present in the aqueous phase and has a significant effect on the extractability of the target element (e.g. addition of HF suppresses the extraction of uranium and protactinium from chloride media), its concentration and crystal radius are added. 

Regarding the organic phase, the concentration of TBP (%) is used as a feature, as well as the dielectric constant (ε) of the solvent used, since it defines the intensity and nature of interaction involved during the solvent extraction of metals. Dielectric constant of TBP (ε=8.34) is used when undiluted TBP is used as an organic phase. Other features include the O/A ratio (equal to 1 in most cases) and the mixing time (seconds). The kinetics aspects of the solvent extraction are not studied here since the all of the data included in the database are reported at equilibrium, but further work will be dedicated to the study of those kinetics aspects, using more relevant features such as viscosity of the phases and hydrodynamic conditions. Temperature was not selected as a feature since most of the experimentally determined values have been obtained at room temperature (25°C).
